If you gonna use this atm, don't lmao.

README is a WIP for now, as everything else is as well.

There will eventually be an ISO, but for now you'll need to rebase.

# Rebase

From Silverblue/Kinoite/any:

```bash
# Gnome
sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/pupyrinth/umbra:latest
```
